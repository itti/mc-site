**Mission Statement**
[Manglacharan](http://www.manglacharan.com/) is dedicated to shedding light on the treasure trove of knowledge passed down by our ancestors, which has not yet been translated into English. For the past ten years [Manglacharan](http://www.manglacharan.com/) has provided translations of passages from important theological and historical texts within the Sikh tradition, namely from:

Having settled in the diaspora, our generation, who now have the time and resources, are eager to understand their rich history and cultural context. Unfortunately, due to many lost and mistranslated works, one can feel lost and uncertain of the meanings and context of these texts. Over the years we have been slowly working to draw attention to a vast bank of masterworks that shed a new light to the Sikh path.  
  
Manglacharan has also created the Suraj Podcast, which is a dedicated Podcast covering chapters from the Suraj Prakash (1843) text, covering the lives of the Sikh Gurus. For more information visit: [www.surajpodcast.com](http://www.surajpodcast.com/) - the Suraj Podcast is available on all platforms, Soundcloud, Spotify, iTunes, and Youtube.   
  
Your support for this intense work is instrumental in securing this knowledge bank for our future generations. If you feel this a worthy project, we encourage you to share this link with your friends and family.
