Giani Gian Singh, in his Naveen Panth Prakash, describes the celebrations following a military campaign victory by Baghel Singh's troops, the Karora Misal, and the Raja of Patiala, Amar Singh.

ਦੂਧ ਸਿਤਾ ਯੁਤ ਭੰਗ ਕੀ ਦੇਗ ਪੁਨਾ ਨ੍ਰਿਪ ਨੈ ਕਰਵਾਇ ਛਕਾਈ ॥
The Raja *Amar Singh* pleased the entire army by making a sweet Cannabis Sacrament *Bhang Ki Degh* in milk.

ਪੀ ਕਰਿ ਭੰਗ ਨਿਹੰਗ ਭੁਜੰਗਿ ਭਏ ਖੁਸ਼ਿ ਭੂਪਤਿ ਪੈ ਬਹੁ ਭਾਈ ॥
Drinking this cannabis the Nihang Bhujangis were greatly pleased with the Raja.

ਔਰ ਘਣੋ ਕੁਣਕਾ ਕਰਵਾਇ ਛਕਾਇ ਦਯੋ ਸਭਿ ਪੰਥਹਿ ਤਾਂਈ ॥
Also great amounts of Karah Prashaad were made and freely distributed to the Panth *army of Karora Singhia Misal*.

ਯੌ ਪਟਲੇਸ ਪੈ ਪੰਥ ਅਸੇਸ ਭਯੋ ਤਬਿ ਮੋਦ ਬਿਸੇਸ ਮਹਾਂਈ ॥੮੩॥
In this way great amounts of Karah Prashaad and Bhang Ki Degh *Cannabis Sacrament* was distributed to the Panth and the Raja became greatly loved by the Singhs.
