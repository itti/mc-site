ਦੁਇ ਮੁਖ ਮੰਡਲ ਕਾਨਨ ਕੁੰਡਲ । ਡੋਲਤਿ ਸ਼ੋਭਤਿ ਮਨਹੁ ਅਖੰਡਲ । 
ਸੁੰਦਰ ਸੂਖਮ ਸਿਰ ਉਸ਼ਨੀਕ । ਊਪਰ ਜਿਗਾ ਬੰਧਿ ਬਿਧਿ ਨੀਕ ।18।
His face and the earrings around his ears were round, the earrings would sway so sweetly; he looked as if Indra the God of Heaven.

ਮਨਹੁ ਸ਼ਾਂਤਿ ਰਸ ਕੇ ਧਰਿ ਬੇਸ । ਸੋਹਤਿ ਸੂਰਜ ਗ੍ਯਾਨ ਵਿਸ਼ੇਸ਼ ।
It was as if he took the very form of peacefulness *shant ras*, uniquely  gloriously shining like the sun of wisdom
