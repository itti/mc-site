During a hunting expedition outside of the village of Ramdas, Guru Hargobind Sahib was approached by a local Hindu who was requesting help to stop Muslims butchering cows:

ਪੁਨ ਕਰ ਜੋਰਿ ਬਤਾਇਸਿ ਬਾਤਿ । "ਨਿਕਟ ਦੁਸ਼ਟ ਗੋ ਕਰਤੇ ਘਾਤਿ । 
ਤਿਨ ਕੇ ਬਸ ਨਹਿ ਆਵਤਿ ਸੋਈ । ਕਤਰਿ ਓਜ ਕੋ ਮੈਂ ਤਹਿ ਜੋਈ" ।੩।
After *saluting Guru Hargobind Singh* he clasped his hands and began to say, "There are vile people close to here butchering cows and they are trying to get hold of more cows with great effort.

ਸੁਨਿ ਸਤਿਗੁਰੁ ਸੋ ਆਗੇ ਕਰ੍ਯੋ । ਹਯ ਧਵਾਇ ਚਾਲੇ ਰਿਸਿ ਧਰ੍ਯੋ । 
ਹੁਤੇ ਨਿਕਟ ਹੀ ਜਾਇ ਨਿਹਾਰੇ । ਖੜਗ ਨਿਕਾਸ੍ਯੋ ਤਤਛਿਨ ਮਾਰੇ ।੪।
Listening to this Satiguru Hargobind mounted his horse and proceeded ahead with great anger, seeing where they were they closed the distance, taking out his sword he quickly slaughtered them.

ਭਾਜ ਚਲੇ ਕੁਛ ਘੇਰਿ ਪ੍ਰਹਾਰੇ । ਖੰਡ ਖੰਡ ਕਰਿ ਧਰ ਪਰ ਡਾਰੈ ।
Some of them ran away, but they were flanked, surrounded and attacked, they were chopped down and then into pieces.

Guru Gobind Singh Ji carried the tradition laid out by his grandfather for the protection of cows. He writes in Ugardanthi, asking Devi to bless Him with the strength to:

ਗਾਊ ਘਾਤ ਕਾ ਦੋਖ ਜਗ ਸਿਉਂ ਮਿਟਾਊ ।
(May I) eliminate the great sin of cow butchering in the world.

Ugardanthi, Chakka 5
