ਮੈਤ੍ਰਿਯ ਕਰੁਨਾ ਦ੍ਵੈ ਲਖੋ ਮੁਦਤਾ ਤੀਜੀ ਜਾਨ । 
ਚਤੁਰ ਉਪੇਖ੍ਯਾ ਜਿਸ ਬਿਖੈ ਸਨਮੁਖ ਸੇ ਪਹਿਚਾਨ । 
A Sanmukh (someone face on with the Divine) is one who has these 4 qualities within: 
friendliness [maitri], 
compassion [karuna], 
joyfulness [mudita], 
& equanimity [upekhya]

Nanak Prakash [1824], author: the Great Poet Santokh Singh Sunset [utraradh], Sunray [anshu / chapter] 43. [[Suraj]] Prakash

Friendliness [maitri] Understand everyone as your friend, don't get jealous seeing someone else's joy, giving money or knowledge to anyone, forgiving to everyone like you are with a friend, these are the qualities of friendliness

Compassion [karuna] To see someone lower and not become arrogant, to have compassion, if they don't have as much knowledge, strength, intellect, or wealth, understand them as your younger brother and do what you can do help them reach a higher level

Joyfulness [mudita] To be joyful to everyone, seeing someone else's great knowledge, virtue, happiness, not to get jealous but to partake in such happiness, such a person is wise, who causes others to be happy, having this mindset no one slanders others

Equanimity [upekhya] In speaking according to the Guru's teachings, spreading the peace giving teachings, if someone doesn't accept them don't be stubborn and just understand its not in their fate [pralabh karam]. Be silent and move on

These are the definitions given by Santokh Singh in Nanak Prakash, where Guru Nanak is explaining how to remain face on with the Divine through these ways of interaction. These quartet of qualities are considered sisters in texts like Prabodh Chandar Natak.
