Reading Suraj Prakash, a story of Guru Hari Rai, who in entertaining two Pahari Kings had two Sikhs display their strength in wrestling 

ਭੁਜਨਿ ਠੋਕਤੇ ਸਬਦ ਉਠਾਵੈ । ਨਰਨ ਪਹਾਰੀ ਰਿਦੇ ਡਰਾਵੈ । 
Smacking their own biceps, a crack erupted 
The Pahari men were frightened in their heart


The confident young wrestlers of Guru Hari Rai wrestled in the court for 45 minutes to everyone's delight - later one of them proclaimed: "We could lift up each of their mountains (Kahlor & Handoor) and smash them together"

A pretty interesting passage even just for the detailed description of the wrestling, how they were grappling for superior tactical positioning, sometimes going low, sometimes going high, chest on chest at times. This is from Raas 9, Chapter 7
