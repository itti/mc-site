The Battle of Rohilla, Guru Hargobind Sahib's second battle ends with a 3 on 1 skirmish, where Guru Hargobind fought against two Khatris, Karamchand *Chandu's son* and Ratanchand *Gherar's son; Gherar was killed by Sikhs upon their arrival to Rohilla* and the Mughal general Adbul Khan from Jalandar. Guru Hargobind finishes the battle by shooting Ratanchand, slicing Abdulkhan's head off, and breaking the joints and crushing to the ground Chandu's son, Karamchand. Following the battle, Guru Hargobind remarks to Bidhi Chand the passage below:

ਬਿਧੀ ਚੰਦ ਸੋਂ ਕਹਿ ਮੁਸਕਾਵਤਿ । ਜਿਸ ਬਿੱਦ੍ਯਾ ਕੋ ਸਦਾ ਕਮਾਵਤਿ । 
ਸੋ ਅਬਿ ਆਈ ਕਾਮ ਹਮਾਰੇ । ਅਰੇ ਰਿਪੁਨਿ ਗਨ ਕੋ ਰਣ ਮਾਰੇ ।੨੩।
Guru Hargobind laughingly said to Bidhi Chand, "This *Shastar* Vidiya that we continuously train in has shown its worth today, in the battlefield we fought and killed countless enemies.

ਅਬਦੁਲ ਖਾਨ ਅਰ੍ਯੋ ਬਹੁ ਲਰ੍ਯੋ । ਖੜਗ ਜੰਗ ਕੋ ਕਰਿ ਕਰਿ ਮਰ੍ਯੋ । 
ਘਨੇ ਘਾਇ ਘਾਲੇ ਅਰੁ ਖਾਏ । ਦੋਨਹੁ ਖਤ੍ਰੀ ਮਾਰਿ ਗਿਰਾਏ ।੨੪।
Abdul Khan *the Mughal General* fought viciously with his sword, attempting strikes he eventually was struck down and died while fighting. The two Khatris *Karamchand and Ratanchand* were also killed and thrown down.

ਪਿਤ ਪਲਟਾ ਚਾਹਤਿ ਨਿਤ ਰਹੇ । ਅਬਿ  ਸਭਿ ਹੀ ਪੂਰੇ ਕਰਿ ਦਏ । 
ਸੰਘਰ ਘੋਰ ਘਨੋ ਘਮਸਾਨ । ਤੁਰਕ ਹਜ਼ਾਰਨਿ ਕੋ ਅਸਵਾਨ।੨੫।
*Karamchand's* desire for revenge *as Guru Hargobind killed his father Chandu*, will remain forever *unsatisfied*, as now I have settled all his accounts. It was a vicious and fierce battle that was fought, thousands of Turks were wiped out."
