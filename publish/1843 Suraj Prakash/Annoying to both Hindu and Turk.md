Khalsa - the Pain of both Turks and Hindus  
  
Below Guru Gobind Singh is responding to news that a Sikh caravan was looted by Ranghars and Gujjars of the neighboring village Noh.  
  
ਸੁਨਿ ਕਰਿ ਗੁਰ ਉਰ ਧਰਿ ਕਰਿ ਕ੍ਰੋਧਾ । ਕਹ੍ਯੋ ਬਨਹੁ ਅਬਿ ਸਭਿ ਸਿਖ ਜੋਧਾ ।  
Listening to this Guru Gobind Singh established great rage in his heart and said, "Now all my Sikhs will become warriors  
  
ਹਿੰਦੂ ਤੁਰਕ ਆਂਖ ਤ੍ਰਿਣ ਪਰੇ । ਨਹਿਂ ਨਿਕਰਹਿ ਅਬਿ ਸੋ ਦੁਖ ਭਰੇ ।  
And we will become like dirt in the eyes of Hindus and Turks, now they won't be able to get it out, and it'll cause them great pain.  
  
ਇਹ ਬਦਲਾ ਹਮ ਤਿਨ ਸਨ ਲੈ ਹੈਂ । ਮੂਢਨਿ ਕੋ ਸਜ਼ਾਇ ਦ੍ਰਿੜ ਦੈ ਹੈ ।  
We will get revenge with them, firmly giving punishment out to these idiots.  
  
After the Singhs were successful in battle and retrieved all the looted properly, they hunted in the near by forests:  
  
ਬਹੁਰ ਅਖੇਰ ਬ੍ਰਿੱਤ ਕੁਛ ਕੀਨੋ । ਸ੍ਰੀ ਪ੍ਰਭੁ ਬਨ ਮਹਿਂ ਬਿਚਰਨ ਕੀਨੋ ।  
Afterwards they thought they would hunt in the forests and Sri Prabhu, Guru Gobind Singh, roamed through the forests.  
  
ਸੂਕਰ ਸਸੇ ਝਂਖਾਰ ਬਡੇਰੇ । ਹਿਤ ਆਮਿਖ ਕੇ ਹਤੇ ਘਨੇਰੇ ।  
Many wild boar, rabbits, and deer, for the sake of their meat were killed in great numbers.
