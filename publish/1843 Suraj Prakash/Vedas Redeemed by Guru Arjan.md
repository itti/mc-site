While Guru Arjan Dev Ji was compiling the Pothi Sahib, the Four Vedas *which each have four sections, so 16 of them, and the 17th being Brahma himself* all took human form in this world because of their Arrogance. These 17 men were Bhatts, or bards, and they traveled far and wide searching for redemption before arriving at the feet of Guru Arjan, who then had them recite Gurbani, not in Sanskrit, but in the vernacular language of men, so it may be understood easily. Only after they praised the Gurus were they redeemed for their arrogance and Guru Arjan then blessed them to be Sikhs. Some time then passed before they left their body and returned to their original form as the Vedas. ⁣  
⁣  
ਇਕ ਸੌ ਬਾਈ ਰਚੇ ਸਵੈਯੇ ਪੰਚਹੁਂ ਗੁਰ ਕੋ ਸਜੁਸ ਬਨਾਇ ।⁣  
The *17* Bhatts *bards* wrote 122 Svaiya verses in praise of the *first* five Gurus. ⁣  
⁣  
ਸ੍ਰੀ ਅਰਜਨ ਕੋ ਕੀਨਿ ਸੁਨਾਵਨਿ ਪਰਮ ਪ੍ਰੇਮ ਮਨ ਮਹਿਂ ਉਪਜਾਇ । ⁣  
Listening to this, great love arose in the mind of the Exalted Guru Arjan.⁣  
⁣  
ਪਦ ਅਰਬਿੰਦ ਕਰੀ ਪੁਨ ਬੰਦਨ ਦੀਨ ਭਏ ਭਾਟ ਜੁ ਸਮੁਦਾਇ । ⁣  
Then all Bhatts humbly bowed down to the Lotus-like Feet of Guru Arjan.⁣  
⁣  
ਚਿਤ ਮਹਿਂ ਚਾਹਤਿ ਸਿਖ ਬਨਿਬੇ ਕਉ ਜਾਚਤਿ ਸ਼ਾਂਤਿ ਸੁ ਚਿਤ ਮਹਿਂ ਆਇ ।37।⁣  
They requested their inner desire that they become Sikhs, so within their mind they may receive tranquility. ⁣  
⁣  
ਭਏ ਪ੍ਰਸੰਨ ਬਹੁਤ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਅਰਜਨ ਤਿਨ ਕੀ ਕ੍ਰਿੱਤ ਗ੍ਰਿੰਥ ਲਿਖਵਾਇ । ⁣  
In becoming greatly pleased with the Bhatts, Guru Arjan wrote their works into the Guru Granth Sahib *as the Bhattan Di Svaiye*. ⁣  
⁣  
ਮਨ ਬਾਂਛਤਿ ਬਰ ਦੀਨਿ ਸਭਿਨਿ ਕੋ ਸਿੱਖ੍ਯ ਕਰੇ ਸ਼ਾਂਤੀ ਉਪਜਾਇ । ⁣  
Guru Arjan satisfied their humble request and bestowed upon them Sikhi, bringing peace to their minds. ⁣  
⁣  
ਭ੍ਰਮ ਪਰਹਰ੍ਯੋ ਭਏ ਸਭਿ ਨਿਰਮਲ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਗੁਰ ਜਸ ਤੇ ਇਹੁ ਫਲ ਪਾਇ । ⁣  
Their spiritual ignorance was dispelled, and all became purified; this was the fruit they received from praising the Exalted Gurus. ⁣  
⁣  
ਕੇਤਿਕ ਦਿਨ ਮੈਂ ਨਿਜ ਤਨ ਤਜਿ ਕੈ ਬੇਦ ਰੂਪ ਹੋਏ ਤਿਸ ਭਾਇ ।38।⁣  
After some days they all left their bodies, and returned to their form of as the Vedas. ⁣
