"The Great Poet Bhai Santokh Singh Ji, the emperor of poetry on the Gurus, the crown jewel of the world's community of poets - as a result of his stand alone poetic practice & Ganges like flow of wisdom, his name will forever remain written in Indian Literature with golden letters." 
- Professor Ashanand Vohra, Member of Punjabi Board of Studies, Kurukshetra university 

Professor Vohra studied Santokh Singh's alaṃkāraśāstra *treatise on poetic devices* commentary of Japu Ji, comparing it with other Sanskrit and Brajbhasha alaṃkāraśāstras. The text which I'll be digitizing soon is an incredible aid to understanding poetics utilized in Guru Nanak's works.
