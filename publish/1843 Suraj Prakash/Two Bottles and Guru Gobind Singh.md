While the [[Suraj]] Prakash (1843) doesn't explicitly Guru Gobind Singh drinking alcohol, an interesting chapter in the Fifth Season (ਪੰਜਵੀ ਰੁੱਤ) where the Guru tests a Sikh from Ujain who was adverse to meat & alcohol. 

The Sikh from Ujain didn't approve of the apparent heartless behaviour of the Guru, killing birds and deer while hunting. At one point the Guru recognizes this and requests two bottles to further agitate him. See the image below for reference, the green footnote is written by Bhai Vir Singh, who claims there was no actual alcohol in those bottles. 

Eventually the Guru while laughing takes a jab at him saying: 

ਹਮਰੀ ਸਿੱਖੀ ਤੈਂ ਕਬਿ ਪਾਈ ? 
ਦਾਸ ਬੈਸਨੋ ਕਾ ਤੁਮ ਭਾਈ 
"since when have you grasped our sikhi? 
oh brother you're a servant of a vaishnu*" 

This is chapter 12 of Rut 5.
