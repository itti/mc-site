ਚਿਰੰਕਾਲ ਗੁਰ ਭਗਤਿ ਕਮਾਈ । ਦਰਸਨ ਠਾਨਤਿ ਬੈਸ ਬਿਤਾਈ । 
ਸ੍ਰੀ ਮੁਕਬਾਕ ਸੁਨਤਿ ਸੁਖੁ ਮਾਨਿ । ਕਰੇ ਕ੍ਰਿਤਾਰਥ ਦ੍ਰਿਗ ਅਰੁ ਕਾਨ ।7।
For the longest time Bidhi Chand cultivated devotional worship focused on the Guru, he had passed his life fixated on the sight of the Guru, always remaining delighted listening to the words of the Exalted Guru, in this way he has made his eyes and ears fruitful.

ਸਫਲ ਸੀਸ ਪਦਬੰਦਨ ਧਰਤਿ । ਤਿਮ ਹਾਥਨਿ ਤੇ ਸੇਵਾ ਕਰਤਿ । 
ਗੁਰ ਕਾਰਜ ਮਹਿਂ ਇਤ ਉਤ ਚਲੇ । ਕੀਨਸਿ ਚਰਨ ਕ੍ਰਿਤਾਰਥ ਭਲੇ ।8।
He would make his head fruitful by placing it at the Lotus-like Feet of  the Guru, and in the same way would make his hands fruitful through the service of the Guru, traveling widely to perform the Guru's tasks by which he made his feet fruitful.

ਸੇਵਤਿ ਸਗਰੀ ਬੈਸ ਬਿਤਾਈ । ਧੰਨ ਜਨਮ ਕਰਿ ਕੈ ਗਤਿ ਪਾਈ । 
ਭਯੋ ਬ੍ਰਿੱਧ ਗੁਰ ਦਰਸਨ ਨਿਹਾਰਤਿ । ਸਰਬ ਪ੍ਰਕਾਰ ਸਕਤਿ ਕੋ ਧਾਰਤਿ ।9।
In doing this service his whole life passed; Blessed is such a life, in doing so he attained the highest state. He grew old seeing the Guru, and had attained all sorts of powers.

ਅੰਤ੍ਰਜਾਮਤਾ ਆਦਿਕ ਭਈ । ਗੁਰ ਕ੍ਰਿਪਾਲ ਤੇ ਗਤਿ ਮਤਿ ਲਈ ।
He was all knowing, along with possessing other powers, with the Guru's compassion he reached such a state.
