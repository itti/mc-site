ਸੀਰ ਨਾ ਸੁਸੰਗ ਮੈਂ ਕੁਸੰਗ ਮੈਂ ਸਂਤੋਖ ਸਿੰਘ ਰਮ੍ਯੋਂ ਨਿਤ ਪਾਪਨਿ ਮੋਂ ਮਿਲ੍ਯੋ ਕਬਿ ਧੀਰ ਨਾ ।  
I, Santokh Singh, don't spend time with good people, always amongst the vile, forever emersed in sins, I've never had fortitude at any point!  

ਧੀਰ ਨਾ ਧਰਤਿ ਕਾਮ ਲੰਪਟ ਕਠੋਰ ਕੂਰ ਬੋਰ੍ਯੋ ਮੈਂ ਬਿਕਾਰਨ ਮੈਂ ਭਯੋ ਮਨ ਤੀਰ ਨਾ ।  
I never cling to courage, my mind is forever intoxicated with disgusting desires, I'm drowning in vice, my mind hasn't become straightened!    
   
ਤੀਰ ਨਾ ਪਛਾਨ੍ਯੋ ਤੁਮੈਂ ਦੂਰ ਕਰਿ ਜਾਨ੍ਯੋ ਪ੍ਰਭੂ ਆਪਨੇ ਉਧਾਰ ਕੀ ਬਿਚਾਰੀ ਤਤਬੀਰ ਨਾ ।  
I've not recognized you close *within*, only thinking of you as separate and far oh Prabhu, I've not contemplate or planned how I will be saved!  
 
 ਬੀਰ ਨਾ ਭਗਤ ਭੇਖਧਾਰੀ ਹਿਤ ਨਾਰੀ ਜਿਮ ਰਾਖੀ ਪੈਜ ਤੈਸੇ ਮੇਰੀ ਹੇਰੋ ਤਕਸੀਰ ਨਾ ।  
Like you kept the honour of that guy without any heroic spirit, no devotion, who just kept your form for the sake of a woman, in the same way don't look upon my faults!

Bhai Vir Singh comments on the fourth line, writing that this is a reference to the Weaver and Princess tale in book one *Loss of Friends* of the Panchtantra. In this tale, a weaver falls in love with a princess. Realizing he would never seem attractive to the princess he sulks until helped by his carpenter friend who constructs a wooden air vehicle resembling Garura. The weaver then dresses up as the form of Vishnu and flies towards the princess, who he quickly tricks and marries. This weaver delights in love with the princess for some time roleplaying as Vishnu all the while. At some point her father the King finds himself in a seemingly unwinnable battle, where he calls his son-in-law, thinking this imposter Vishnu would provide assistance. The imposter Vishnu plays the part, externally confident while trembling inside about how he will banish everyone from the battlefield. The real Garura in heaven hears this and pleads with Vishnu to intervene on this situation. Vishnu accepts manifesting himself in the body of the weaver, destroying all the enemies in battle. Vishnu saved the imposter weaver, who was just engrossed in the love of the princess.
