In the passage below Alam Singh, the treasurer of Guru Gobind Singh's court, describes to the Guru how Sahibzada Ajit Singh, at the age of 13, fought in the Battle of Anandpur in 1700.  

ਆਲਮ ਸਿੰਘ ਭਾਨ੍ਯੋਂ ਅਹਿਵਾਲਾ । ਪ੍ਰਭ ਜੀ ਸੰਘਰ ਭਯੋ ਬਿਸਾਲਾ ।੩।  
Alam Singh spoke about the condition of the battle, "Powerful One (Guru Gobind Singh)! It was a colossal battle! 

ਸ੍ਰੀ ਅਜੀਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਕਰ੍ਯੋ ਘਮੰਡ । ਬਾਨ ਪ੍ਰਚੰਡ ਸੁ ਤੂਰਨ ਛੰਡਿ । ਬਿਚਰਤਿ ਸ਼ੱਤ੍ਰੁਨਿ ਮਹਿ ਧਰ ਧੀਰਜ । ਹਤੇ ਬਹੁਤ ਕਰਿ ਕਰਿ ਨਿਜ ਬੀਰਜ ।੪।  
The highest, (Sahibzada) Ajit Singh fought with great honour, from his bow he accurately shot ferocious arrows, combing through the enemy with great composure. With his strength he killed many ! 

ਲਗੀ ਤੁਫੰਗ ਤੁਰੰਗਮ ਗਿਰ੍ਯੋ । ਉਤਰ੍ਯੋ ਹੁਇ ਸੁਚੇਤ ਤਰ ਖਰ੍ਯੋ । ਪਹੁਂਚਿ ਦਾਸ ਨੇ ਦੂਸਰ ਕੀਨ । ਭਏ ਅਰੋਹਨ ਜੁੱਧ ਪ੍ਰਬੀਨ ।੫।  
His horse was struck with a bullet and began to fall, but with great awareness he jumped off (just in time), and standing (in the battlefield), his attendants brought another horse, which upon mounting continued the great fight! .
