Nanak Prakash (1824) by Santokh Singh mentions Baba Nanak traveling to Sachkhand *the Realm of Truth*, visiting the Exalted Timeless Divine. Guru Nanak arriving in Sachkhand walks through many small gardens with trees bearing ripe fruit, before reciting the ਸੋ ਦਰੁ (Guru Granth: 6) composition directly to the Divine. 

ਮਹਿਮਾ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਅਕਾਲ ਸੁਨਿ ਕਾਨੇ । ਭੇ ਪਰਸੀਦ ਮੰਦ ਮੁਸਕਾਨੇ । 
The Exalted Timeless Divine heard this praise, became pleased and chuckled 

- Nanak Prakash, Purabāradh, Chapter 73, verse 54
