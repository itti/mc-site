What is Anubhav? 

ਵਸਤੁ ਵਿਚਾਰ ਧਿਆਵਤੇ ਮਨ ਪਾਵੈ ਬਿਸਰਾਮ ।
On contemplating Vastu Vichar*, the mind obtains peace. 

ਰਸ ਸ੍ਵਾਦਤਿ ਸੁਖ ਊਪਜੈ ਅਨੁਭਵ ਜਾਂ ਕੋ ਨਾਮ ।42।
Enjoying this delicious flavour *of this contemplation*, is what is called Anubhav *experiencial feeling*

*Vastu Vichar is the investigation into the truth of the material world. In the frame of a battle of virtues and vices, Vastu Vichar is the general which defeats Kaam, for it sees past the allure and into the reality of desire. Vastu literally means item, and Vichar means contemplation, but more literally an exploration, a roaming through an idea, leaving no stone unturned. 

Guru Gobind Singh in his first verse of Jaap Sahib explains how the Divine cannot be comprehended but only experienced: 

ਅਨੁਭਉ ਪ੍ਰਕਾਸ illuminated through experience 

Above the Great Poet Santokh Singh defines what Anubhav (or anubhau) means and how to obtain it.
