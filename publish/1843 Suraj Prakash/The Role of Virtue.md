Cognition (ਬ੍ਰਿਤਿ) & the Role of Virtue (ਗੁਣ)

ਅੰਤਹਿਕਰਣ ਕਰਣ ਬ੍ਰਿਤਿ ਹੈ ਜੋਇ । ਇੰਦ੍ਰਯ ਦ੍ਵਾਰਾ ਨਿਕਰੈ ਸੋਇ ।
ਨਾਨਾ ਘਟ ਪਟ ਧਰੇ ਪਦਾਰਥ । ਤਿਨਹਿ ਜਾਨਿਬੋ ਹੋਇ ਜਥਾਰਥ ।35।
The mind's task of forming cognition *vritti* occurs from the sense organs expanding out *their interaction with the world*, this forms various objects within the mind which are then understood as a result. 

Note: While now we understand sense organs *sight, hearing, taste, touch, smell* acting as receivers for information, in Vedānta they were thought of as expanding out into the world, like how a lake enters through openings into a field, assuming the form of a field. In the same way, sense-organs form a model of what they interact with, and then it is perceived and discerned within the space of the mind *antahkaran*. 

Role of Virtue

ਸਤਿ ਸੰਤੋਖ ਆਦਿ ਗੁਨ ਪਾਇ । ਬ੍ਰਹਮ ਬਿਖੈ ਬ੍ਰਿਤਿ ਲਾਗਤਿ ਜਾਇ ।
Obtaining virtues like truth, contentment, etc, by doing so results in one's cognition being connected with Braham. 

ਅਲਖ ਲਖਨ ਕੇ ਹਿਤ ਅਨੁਰਾਗੀ । ਪ੍ਰਥਮ ਲਖ੍ਯੋ ਤਿਸ ਤੇ ਹੁਇ ਤ੍ਯਾਗੀ ।4।
One begins to enjoy the experience of the Unknowable, and they begin to lose interest in which they previously understood *as real*.
