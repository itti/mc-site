The writings of Bhai Gurdas appear in two volumes, the first being Vārān, or Ballads, and the second in Kabit and Svaiya metres. These were likely written in the early 17th century. Bhai Gurdas was a nephew of Guru Amardas, and helped Guru Arjan with the compilation of Adi Granth. [[Suraj]] Prakash (1843) also includes a Sanskrit passage by Bhai Gurdas related to the meaning of the mantra Vahiguru. 

Also included in this section are the selected portions from Bhai Gurdas, the second, from the late 18th century, associated with the Giānīā Bungā of Amritsar.
