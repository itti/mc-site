The Faridkot Tika is easily recognized as the best Tika *commentary* within the Sikh Sampradyas of Adi Guru Granth Sahib. Using the oral tradition that has been passed down through generations numerous Nirmala, Udasi and other scholars complied this Tika during the 19th century. ⁣  
⁣  
Below is a short paraphrase translation of a paragraph within the preface *bhoomika* of the Faridkot Tika.⁣  
⁣  
"The Sanatan Sampradya's meanings *of Gurbani* that have come down through an oral tradition *Seena-b-Seena*, having not been written down have now caused disagreement *with the meanings* during the Sikh Raj period.⁣  
⁣  
Other ideologies *Matan* have now started to disrespect the Mahatama's of the *traditional* Sikh Sampradyas and are not respecting the Sanatan Sampradya meanings *of Gurbani* and are presenting their own meanings."⁣
