In this passage, Guru Nanak's composition (found in the Bhai Bhano recension of [[PUBLISHED/publish/-Adi/Adi]] Granth),  speaks to the futility of conversation when both parties aren't receptive.

In this dark age there are , how can I keep my honour?
If I speak they'll say, "He just chats so much"
If I remain silent they'll say, "His mind has no sense"
If I stay seated they'll say, "He's sitting stubbornly"
If I get up and leave they'll say, "He deceived us that's why he left"
If I lower my head they'll say, "The devotee is scared!"
There's no response or place to chill which causes release . 
Here and there oh Nanak, the Doer keeps honour.
