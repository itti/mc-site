Guru Tegh Bahadur's Salok for his wife Mata Gujari

In Episode 4 (SZN 1) of the Suraj Podcast X, we heard how Mama (uncle) Kirpal Chand remarks to his sister, Mata Gujari, that she shouldn't remain sad after hearing of the passing of her husband (Guru Tegh Bahadur). Mama Kirpal Chand reminds her sister that the Guru had sent a salok for her, telling her to remember those teachings. While Guru Tegh Bahadur wrote Salok Mahala 9 (Guru Granth Sahib: 1426-1429) in a Dehli jail, this specific salok, #52, was written and directed to his wife, Mata Gujari. 

ਜੋ ਉਪਜਿਓ ਸੋ ਬਿਨਸਿ ਹੈ ਪਰੋ ਆਜੁ ਕੈ ਕਾਲਿ ॥
Whoever has taken birth will pass away, either today, tomorrow, or the day after. 

ਨਾਨਕ ਹਰਿ ਗੁਨ ਗਾਇ ਲੇ ਛਾਡਿ ਸਗਲ ਜੰਜਾਲ ॥੫੨॥
Oh Nanak! sing the virtues of Hari, let go of all other entanglements.

Guru Granth Sahib: 1429 

Note: Saloks #50 and #51 were written for Guru Tegh Bahadur's mother, Mata Nanaki, while #53 was written to test his son, Guru Gobind Singh.
