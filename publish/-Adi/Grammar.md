The first step to understanding Gurbani would be to learn about the grammar, using the text below:

Shackle's Sacred Language of the Sikhs: https://archive.org/details/AnIntroductionToTheSacredLanguageOfTheSikhs/page/n95/mode/2up

- I recommend completing a lesson every few days, ensuring you are completing the exercises at the end of each lesson.
- Eventually a section on this website will include answers to each lesson
- Disclaimer: this is just the beginning of your journey learning about the grammar used in Gurbani, there are sections of Gurbani which require additional instruction for which this material is not completely relevant. But overall this is the best first step. 

For further information:
Sahib Singh's Gurbani Vyakaran: https://archive.org/details/gurbani-viakaran
- This provides additional lessons which cover sections like Sahaskriti but it requires intermediate level of Punjabi reading comprehension.
