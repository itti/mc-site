ਜਿਤੁ ਦਰਿ ਲਖ ਮਹੰਮਦਾ ਲਖ ਬ੍ਰਹਮੇ ਬਿਸਨ ਮਹੇਸ
At the Divine's door, countless Mohammads, Brahmas, Vishnus, and Shivas reside

- Guru Nanak

This passage, while not in the modern printed [[PUBLISHED/publish/-Adi/Adi]] Guru Granth Sahib, is found in many handwritten manuscripts. This image is from Bhai Mani Singh Shahid's manuscript of Adi & Dasam Granth, dated 1713.

JP Singh in his Prachin Bira (Old Manuscripts, page 352), writes that this passage flows in the style and form of Guru Nanak's poetry, while detailing its prevalence in extant manuscripts.

The passage lists countless deities from various traditions and then concludes:

"None obtained peace without the True Guru's teachings"
ਕਿਸੇ ਸਾਂਤਿ ਨ ਆਈਆ ਬਿਨੁ ਸਤਿਗੁਰ ਕੇ ਉਪਦੇਸ

For those who listen to katha of Sant Gurbachan Singh, the beginning line, ਜਿਤੁ ਦਰਿ ਲਖ ਮਹੰਮਦਾ ਲਖ ਬ੍ਰਹਮੇ ਬਿਸਨ ਮਹੇਸ, is often quoted. It matches in mindset to sections within Guru Gobind Singh's Bachittar Natak, in [[Dasam Guru Granth Sahib/Dasam]] Granth
