In the Sikhan Di Bhagtamala, there is a story where Guru Arjan is speaking to Vedantic practitioners explaining to them that Gurbani contains all the essence of Vedanta 

ਸਬਦੁ ਸਭ ਵੇਦਾਂਤ ਦਾ ਸਾਰੁ ਹੈ । (pauri 27, jagna sakhi)

These Sikhs were having difficulty with their Vedantic practice and the Guru instructs them to utilize Gurbani in their practice: 

ਜੇ ਸਬਦ ਦਾ ਅਭਿਆਸ ਕਰੀਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਤਾਂ ਤਤੁ ਗਿਆਨੁ ਦ੍ਰਿੜ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ । 
Those who practice the Shabad have the essence of wisdom enshrined within them.

In another portion of the text we also find: 

ਭਾਖਾ ਬਾਣੀ ਗਿਰੰਥ ਜੀ ਵਿਖੇ ਸਭ ਵੇਦਾਂ ਦਾ ਤਤੁ ਸੁਗਮੁ ਕਰਿ ਕੇ ਕਹਿਆ ਹੈ 
Writing the vernacular writings within the [[Adi]] Granth Ji the essence of the Vedas was described in an understandable format

Bhagatmala and its contribution to Vernacular Vedanta certainly needs to be explored, its quite specific, at one point Guru Arjan argues against Pariṇāmavāda in favour of Vivartavada when explaining this shabad to a yogi attached:
