ਅਧਿਸ਼ਠਾਨ ਤੈਂ ਭਿੰਨ ਨਹਿਂ, ਜਗਤ ਨਿਵ੍ਰਿਤ ਬਖਾਨ ॥  
The removal of *seeing/experiencing* the world that is spoken about *when speaking of liberation*, is not distinct *a removal* from the ground of reality *adhiṣṭhāna*  

ਸਰਪ ਨਿਵ੍ਰਿਤ ਰਜੁ ਜਿਮ, ਭਏ ਰਜੁ ਕੋ ਗਯਾਨ ॥  
Just as *liberating* knowledge of the rope is not different from the removal of the snake. .  

Vichar Sagar, chapter 1, verse 28. .  
.  
Translators note: This passage attempts to explain that the association of liberation with the cessation of the world, in the sense that the world melts away would be incorrect; rather, it should be viewed as a changing of perception/vision in such a way that one is able to see the Truth, or the underlying ground of reality on which the entire cosmos is acting upon. The world is not separate in any sense from that ground of reality *adhiṣṭhāna*, rather our inability to see this reality is only due to the faulty perception which has us viewing a frightening snake, whereas it is only a rope. The illusion *Maya* entices and frightens us; yet at the same time the snake is not separate from the ground of reality *i.e. it only has its form due to the ground of reality*.
