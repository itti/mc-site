Wild - the beauty of Anoop Kaur described so wonderfully in this Punjabi Kissa dedicated to her
 
"With an extremely beautiful sweet face and thin body, as if fashioned by the teacher of Desire (kāmdevtā)" Would love to read your take on these passages as well !

On Panjab Digital Library you can find this wonderful Kissa (Punjabi short story) of Anoop Kaur, a woman who desired and attempted to seduce Guru Gobind Singh, likely written in the late 19th or early 20th century.

Many scholars of the writings of Guru Gobind Singh contend that the Guru himself wrote about this wild event within the Chritaropakhyan [1696 CE], stories 21-23. The textual evidence in my opinion also heavily leans in that direction, which is mind-blowing to think about.
