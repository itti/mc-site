In the Puratan Janamsakhi, when Guru Nanak goes to Banaras, he replies to a question about his background, to which he replies, "I am a Hindu". This should be taken in context with an earlier passage where he speaks to the temporality of such identities, when famously proclaiming, "There is no Hindu, No Muslim" (ਨਾ ਕੋ ਹਿੰਦੂ ਨ ਮੁਸਲਮਾਨ).
