The image is a Hukamnama from Takht Sri Patna Sahib, likely from 1865-1875. In listing the Five Senior Caretakers of the Takht, it lists them as the following: Senior Pujari Ganda Singh, Junior Pujari Dharam Singh, Granthi Charat Singh, Ardasia Gopal Singh, Sukhaee Karam Singh. ⁣

The Sukhaee Position was a senior position held at all Takhts, who's duty was solely related to preparing Sukha *Cannabis* for the congregation. The Takhts outside of Punjab, Takht Sri Patna Sahib and Takht Sri Hazur Sahib still continue this tradition to this very day.
