Vir Singh notes how the new Akalis (Singh Sabha) went too far when reforming practices, without the permission of the community, stopped traditional practices like celebrating Holi. Interesting to see how it has made a comeback now with Sikhs celebrating the festival worldwide.

He says the traditions like Holi were stopped "perhaps it was their ignorance of the history of the Gurus, or because they were in a blinded confusion from the Western Enlightenment"
