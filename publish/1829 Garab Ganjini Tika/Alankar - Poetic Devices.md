The Great Poet Kavi Santokh Singh defines poetic devices (alankar) in his commentary of  as: 

"The mental image that is formed from the words [shabad] and their meaning [Arth]; the splendid beauty that bursts out of these words are due to ornamental placement of these words. Just as beautiful ornaments bring out the beauty of a person, similarly 'literary devices' [Alankaaran] beautify the words they are placed with. " 

- Garab Ganjini Tika [1829] page 13. This text is essentially an Alaankar-Shastra, a Treatise on Literary Devices.
