Written in 1829, under the patronage of Raja Udai Singh of Kaithal, this text is a commentary on Guru Nanak Dev Ji's Japu Ji, exploring both the meanings of the composition along with the poetic devices used. Written by Santokh Singh, renown as the Mahākavī, the Great Poet, this text demonstrates the poetic complexity of Japu Ji, and in many ways can be understood as an alankār śāstrā, a guide to poetics. This text has yet to be translated. 

For more information see Vohra's (1975) exploration of the text.
