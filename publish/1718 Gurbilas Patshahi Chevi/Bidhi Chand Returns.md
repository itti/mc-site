Gurbilas Patshahi Devi *1718* describes the scene when Bidhi Chand returns from stealing back the rightful horse of Guru Hargobind. Shah Jahan through his army intercepted two very fine horses which were being delivered to Guru Hargobind, this scene is the return after the first horse is recaptured.

ਦੂਰਹੁੰ ਦੇਖ ਉਠੇ ਸੁਖ ਸਾਗਰ ਜੈਸ ਹਨੂੰ ਗਿਰਿ ਰਾਮ ਦਿਖਾਯੋ ।
The Ocean of Bliss, Guru Hargobind, on seeing Bidhi Chand from far got up in anticipation, like when Hanuman brought the mountain to show Rama.

ਅਸ ਲੀਏ ਬਿਧੀਆ ਚਲ ਆਵਤ ਐਸ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਮੁਖ ਬੈਨ ਅਲਾਯੋ। 
"Bidhi Chand has brought back the horse!" said the Guru from his mouth.

ਦੌਰ ਤਬੈ ਗੁਰੁ ਕੇ ਪਦ ਪੰਕਜ ਆਨੰਦ ਕੈ ਬਿਧੀਆ ਲਪਟਾਯੋ ।
Bidhi Chand ran from far towards the Guru's lotus like feet, clinging to them he was great in bliss !

ਨੀਰਜ ਹਾਥ ਉਠਾਇ ਤਿਸੈ ਗੁਰੁ ਆਨੰਦ ਕੈ ਨਿਜ ਕੰਠ ਲਗਾਯੋ ।
The Guru, with his lotus like hands, lifted Bidhi Chand up, and with great joy gave him a hug.
