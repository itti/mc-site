Gurbilas Patshahi Chhevi 1718 was written down by Bhagat Singh but was narrated by Bhai Mani Singh Shaheed. The text makes several mentions to Guru Hargobind enjoying cannabis in the late afternoon, however new versions of the text expunge this portion, replacing it without the cannabis mention. The photos are from seven different manuscripts from the 18th and 19th centuries where it reads:⁣  
⁣  
ਜਬੈ ਜਾਮ ਦਿਨ ਆਨ ਰਹਾਯੋ । ਸ੍ਰੀ ਗੁਰ ਬਿਜੀਆ ਪਾਨ ਕਰਾਯੋ ।⁣  
When 3 hours were left before sunset *in the afternoon*, the Exalted Guru Hargobind drank cannabis.⁣  
⁣  
The last image is the Patiala University edition which has removed the line, replacing it with:⁣  
⁣  
ਜਬੈ ਜਾਮ ਦਿਨ ਆਨ ਰਹਾਯੋ । ਸ੍ਰੀ ਗੁਰੁ ਮਨ ਮੋ ਆਨੰਦ ਪਾਯੋ । ⁣  
When 3 hours were left before sunset *in the afternoon*, the Exalted Guru Hargobind had great bliss arise in his mind. ⁣

Chapter 18, Gurbilas Patshahi 6, author: Bhagat Singh, narrated by Bhai Mani Singh Shaheed⁣
