[[Gurbilas Patshahi 10]]  (Koer Singh's) account of the Singhs with Bhai [[Mani Singh]] obtaining shahidi is wild, this was written just 13-14 years after the event 

"Many were hung on spikes, many were placed within torture-wheels. At that point the Singhs chanted Akaal, *as they died*, it was as if they were planting the seed *of Sikhi* in the ground. In chanting Akaal they passed away"
