ਜਗਮਾਤ ਸਭੈ ਭਵ ਭਾਰ ਅਫਾਰ ਦੁਖ ਦਾਰੁਨ ਮੋਰ ਅਬੈ ਛੈਕਰੰ ॥ 
Oh Mother of the world! now please destroy my terrible pains from the unbearable weight of oppression on the world!

Swami Harnam Das Udasi provides a long footnote in relation to this line explaining how the Guru is feeling the pain of the people, and writes: "He who wants to experience Brahm *the Divine* must first experience Maya *the illusion*.... The Exalted Guru is fully experienced on both sides and is writing from his own experience" [[Sarbloh]] Granth Steek, Volume 1, Page 155-157
