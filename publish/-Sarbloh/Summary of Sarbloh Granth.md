The demons got the upper hand on the demigods. Vishnu then sends Nārad as an ambassador to Bīrjnād. Bīrjnād would not listen and prepared for battle. At the beginning of the battle the 11 armies of Bīrjnād that were on foot were destroyed.

After the demigods experienced great pain in the battle they went before Akal Purkh and pleaded for help. Akal Purkh manifested himself as Sarbloh (all iron).
