When Bibi Amaro went with her uncle-in-law to meet, Amar Das, to meet Guru Angad, they were taken to eat Langar, Mehima Prakash (1776 CE) describes it as follows:

ਲੇ ਚਲੇ ਸਾਥ ਲੰਗਰ ਕੇ ਮਾਹਿ । ਸੰਗੀ ਸਗਲ ਬੁਲਾਏ ਤਾਹਿ ।
They were taken to the Langar *Bibi Amaro and Amardas*, and Guru Angad called all the attendants *to serve them*.

ਮਾਸ ਭਇਓ ਸਿਧ ਰਸੋਈ । ਅਵਰ ਦਾਲ ਭਾਤ ਭੀ ਹੋਈ ।
Amongst the food was meat and other types of lentils as well.

The text mentions how Guru Angad also ate with them, the text describes it by saying:

ਜਬ ਮਹਾਂ ਪ੍ਰਸਾਦਿ ਸਤਿਗੁਰ ਕਾ ਖਾਇਆ । ਮਹਾਂ ਅਨੰਦ ਪ੍ਰਕਾਸ ਹੋਇ ਆਇਆ ।
When Guru Angad ate the Maha-Prashad *the meat sacrament*, he was filled with great bliss.

ਸਤਿਗੁਰ ਪ੍ਰਸਾਦਿ ਮਹਿਮਾ ਕਿਆ ਕਹੈ । ਜੋ ਪਾਵੈ ਸੋਈ ਸੁਖ ਲਹੈ ।
What can one say about the Prasad *sacrament's* of the True Guru, whoever has enjoyed it has attained its bliss.
