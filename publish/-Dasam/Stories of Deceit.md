The Chritaropakhyan, the short stories of deceit, by Guru Gobind Singh has become topic of much debate since the colonial period. However, traditional learning institutions maintain that the text was written for political, moral, and martial instruction. 

Gurbilas Patshahi Dasvi, from Sukha SIngh written in 1797, mentions a story related to the Guru first battle, where a minister of a hill state approaches with the purpose of deceiving the Guru with a request after much flattery, the guru's response roared like thunder:

ਸ੍ਰੀ ਮੁਖ ਘਨਿ ਜਿਉ ਗਰਜ ਉਚਾਰੋ । ਇਹ ਛਲ ਬਲ ਹਮ ਨ੍ਰਿਪਨ ਨਿਹਾਰੋ ।
ਤੈ ਅਰੁ ਤੇਰੇ ਨ੍ਰਿਪਤ ਬਿਚਾਰਾ । ਏਕ ਚਰਿਤ੍ਰ ਸੁ ਕਰਿਯੋ ਸੁਧਾਰਾ ।126।
"I've seen these types of deceit by kings
Along with the one you concocted with your king 

ਹਮ ਤੋ ਰੈਨ ਦਿਨਾ ਤਿਹ ਥਾਨਾ । ਪੜੈ ਚਰਿਤ੍ਰ ਲਿਖੇ ਬਿਧ ਨਾਨਾ ।
ਜੋ ਨਰ ਹੋਇ ਸੁ ਮੁਗਧ ਗਵਾਰਾ । ਤੁਮਰੋ ਛਲ ਨਹੀ ਸਕੈ ਬਿਚਾਰਾ ।127।
As for me though, I stay here day and night reading stories of deceit and writing them in many ways
Only the most stupid and dull man would not recognize your deceitful plan"

This passage points toward the import of the Chritaropakhyan, that it illuminates on various ways deceit manifests either through flattery, friendship, flirtatious advances or under the guise of piety.
