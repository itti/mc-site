Prof Sahib Singh's steek on Guru Gobind Singh's Jaap Sahib is extremely helpful 

"another delicious aspect (ਸੁਆਦਲੀ ਗਲ) is Satguru didn't use the ligature of alif-laam only for Persian words, he used it to join Sanskrit words, and in mixed Sanskrit and Persian compounds"

So far I've found these two commentaries to be the best resources on Jaap Sahib 

Sahib Singh's commentary - [https://archive.org/details/JaapSahibSteek-ProfSahibSingh/page/n29/mode/2up?view=theater…](https://t.co/92iRLFGsn1) 

Chakar Chandrika by Kartar Singh Nirmala - [https://archive.org/details/jaap_sahib/mode/2up?view=theater…](https://t.co/zpGn2pHNsQ) 

^ This commentary is a beast, 546 pages of detailed explanations and examples.
