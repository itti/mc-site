For centuries the ballad *Chandi Di Vaar* and stories *Chandi Chritar* of Chandi, the Goddess of War, have been read with great passion and aggression to well up heroic spirit before any difficult task. These writings are truly art; submersed in both common folk and classical tunes, poetic structures, languages and mythologies. The wide appeal that it captured during the time is a testament to the universality in both the delivery of the message along with the content. In that spirit, please like, share and subscribe to the Manglacharan Youtube Channel for more videos like this in the future.
