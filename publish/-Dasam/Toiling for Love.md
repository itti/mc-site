The Gopis saying to Krishna

ਬਾਤ ਨ ਜਾਨਤ ਹੋ ਰਸ ਕੀ ਰਸ ਜਾਨਤ ਸੋ ਨਰ ਜੋ ਰਸ ਗਾਖੈ ।
By words love is not known, love is known by those who have been consumed by love.

ਪ੍ਰੀਤ ਪੜੈ ਕਰ ਪ੍ਰੀਤ ਕੜੈ ਰਸ ਰੀਤਨ ਚੀਤ ਸੁਨੋ ਸੋਈ ਚਾਖੈ ।੨੯੭।
Listen, love's way is understood by falling and toiling in love; only they may savour love.

Guru Gobind Singh *1666-1708* writes these beautiful lines within his [[Krishnavatar]], the stories of Krishna, specifically within the Raas Mandal, the stories of Love. These lines are recited by the Gopis in their flirtatious and playful discourse with Krishna, their lover. Love stories during this period were purposefully multilayered allowing for multi-variant readings of the text. These stories and others came under the judgmental eye of the Protestant British Raj which found the lush love stories as scandalous and immoral. This British mentality seeped its way into the Indian population through British institutions and schools, which forever changed the society and it's cultural music, literature and philosophy.
