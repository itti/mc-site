The first photo depicts Guru Gobind Singh's handwriting, eight pages of which are in Bhai Mani Singh Shahid's compilation of Gurbani (Adi & Dasam) dated at 1713. This portion is the beginning of Krishnavatar, the Dasam Skandh (10th Canto of the Bhagavata Purana). Guru Gobind Singh began writing this while in Anandpur Sahib while in his teenage years, and later completed the composition in Paunta Sahib, alongside the river of Yamuna in 1689, at the age of 23.

At the bottom right of the first photo it reads, ""I am reciting the Dasam *Skandh* sitting in Anandpur" ਕਹੇ ਦਸਮ ਪੁਰ ਬੈਠ ਅਨੰਦਾ

The second photo is the next page in the Bhai Mani Singh Shahid saroop where they have provided the Gurbani written in a non-shiksata script (non-calligraphy script).

The digitized 1713 compilation of Gurbani (Adi & Dasam) is available thanks to Kamalpreet Singh Pardesi via www.Gurmatveechar.com -> Gurbani & Literature
