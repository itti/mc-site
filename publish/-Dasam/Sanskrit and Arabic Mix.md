ਸਮਸਤੁਲ ਸਲਾਮ ਹੈਂ ॥ ਸਦੈਵਲ ਅਕਾਮ ਹੈਂ ॥ 
समस्तुल सलाम हैं ॥ सदैवल अकाम हैं ॥ 
samasat-ul-salām hain ॥ sadaival akām hain ॥

This blending of Sanskrit vocab with the Arabic definite article "al" (becoming "ul") is just incredible. Anek-ul-Tarang Hai - Describing the Divine/Universe as a vast ocean with limitless waves (forms). These lines are from Guru Gobind Singh's Jaap composition.

Guru Gobind Singh's Jaap employs a mix of Arabic and Sanskrit in this passage below as he describes the Divine Universe as a vast ocean, containing endless forms, floating some up to safety and drowning others with burden.
