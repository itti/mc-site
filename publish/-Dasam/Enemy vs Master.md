Randhir Singh, who wrote the third part shabadarth of [[Dasam]] Granth, writes a beautiful footnote attached, which was related to this line here speaking of the 'lord of the tiger'. At times the gun is called Lord/Master/King of the tiger and Enemy of the tiger. Like a king/judge has the ability to punish and forgive, the shastar holds the form of Death/Time *kāl* and is the protector of life. 

'ਚਾਰੁ ਨੇਤ੍ਰ' ਸਬਦਾਦਿ ਉਚਾਰੋ । ਤਾਂ ਪਾਛੇ 'ਪਤਿ' ਸਬਦ ਬਿਚਾਰੋ । 
'The beautifully eyed' *deer*, first recite that and then think of 'the master of that deer'*master of a deer = tiger*

'ਨਾਥ' ਸਬਦ ਕਹੁ ਬਹੁਰੋ ਦੀਜੈ । ਨਾਮ 'ਤੁਫੰਗ' ਚੀਨ ਚਿਤਿ ਲੀਜੈ ।286
Then say the word, 'Lord' *lord of a tiger* is the name of a Gun, understand this in your mind.
