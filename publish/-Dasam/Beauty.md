## ਕਹੂੰ ਮ੍ਰਿਗ ਹ੍ਵੈ ਕੈ ਭਲੀ ਭਾਂਤਿ ਮੋਹੇ ॥  
Somewhere You appear as a deer,  
Enticing the mind in many sublime ways  
  
## ਕਹੂੰ ਕਾਮੁਕੀ ਜਿਉ ਧਰੇ ਰੂਪ ਸੋਹੇ ॥੧੩॥  
Elsewhere, as beautiful as Desire's Wife (Rati)  
Adorning a gorgeous form

These lines are written by Guru Gobind Singh in his Bachittar Natak (the Wonderous Drama), in the chapter on the Praise of Death/Time (ਸ੍ਰੀ ਕਾਲ ਜੀ ਦੀ ਉਸਤਤਿ). Within time/death all qualities exist. 

The Guru describes simultaneously great beauty and  destructive chaos as manifesting from same wonderous drama of Time/Death.
