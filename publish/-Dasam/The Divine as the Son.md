ਨਮਸਤੰ ਅਜਨਮੇ। ਨਮਸਤੰ ਸੁਬਨਮੇ । 
Salutation to the Birthless ! 
Salutation to the Divine in the form of a son ! 

The praise of the Divine in opposites by Guru Gobind Singh in Jaap Sahib is wonderful - he wrote this in Poanta Sahib where his son, Ajit Singh, also took birth.

ਸੁਬਨਮੇ - comes from ਸੁਵਨ -> ਸੂਨੁ (putra) ਮਯ (merged in/pervading in) 

The one pervading in the form of a son, or perhaps offspring 

The opposites occur throughout the writings of Guru Gobind Singh to demonstrate how the Divine is within everything 

ਸਰਬ ਕਾਲ ਸਰਬ ਠਉਰ ਏਕ ਸੇ ਲਗਤ ਹੋ
