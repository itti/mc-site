Erroneous Perception - The Other (ਦੁਤੀਆ ਭਾਵ) Throughout Gurbani there's a constant theme focusing on the unified vision of ੧, seeing through the 'Other' (੨/ਦੂਜਾ). Even when beginning a series of stories about the various avatars of Vishnu, Guru Gobind Singh leads from the starting point of a metaphysical unity which only erroneously appears separate and thus results in conflict. 

ਏਕਹ ਰੂਪ ਅਨੂਪ ਸਰੂਪਾ ॥ ਰੰਕ ਭਯੋ ਰਾਵ ਕਹੂੰ ਭੂਪਾ ॥ 
The One form which has indescribable forms; Somewhere as beggar, a prince, and king. 

ਭਿੰਨ ਭਿੰਨ ਸਭਹਨ ਉਰਝਾਯੋ ॥ ਸਭ ਤੇ ਜੁਦੋ ਨ ਕਿਨਹੁੰ ਪਾਯੋ ॥੩੭॥ 
Everyone divided is entangled in conflict In being separated no one has obtained It.
