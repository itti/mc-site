ਕਹੂੰ ਬਰ ਦੇਤ ਕਹੂੰ ਛਲ ਸਿਉ ਛਿਨਾਇ ਲੇਤ
ਸਰਬ ਕਾਲ ਸਰਬ ਠਉਰ ਏਕ ਸੇ ਲਗਤ ਹੋ 
Somewhere as a king bestowing boons, Somewhere taking them away with deceit, 
Through all times, at all places, To me it all appears as the One 

- Guru Gobind Singh in Akal Ustat 

Below (quoted tweet) is the concluding line of the second section of Akal Ustat. Randhir Singh (image below) notes of this section: "*concluding* it is recognized and made clear *the Divine* as One without any other (wahdahu la sharika), that is One, without second (ekadutī)"

Interesting how Randhir Singh essentially quotes from both Chāndogya Upaniṣad, ekamevādvitīyam (एकमेवाद्वितीयं) and an Arabic Islamic proclamation about the Divine's oneness (wahdahu la sharika lahu).
