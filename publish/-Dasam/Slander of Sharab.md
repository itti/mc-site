ਦੀਬੋ ਕਛੂ ਮਯ ਪੀਬੋ ਘਨੋ ਕਹਿ ਸੂਰਨ ਸੋ ਇਹ ਬੈਨ ਸੁਨਾਯੋ ॥
*Balrama speaking*, "Warriors! Pass a little along, and drink even more wine!" ,This is what Balrama told the gathering near Krishna].

ਜੂਝਬੋ ਜੂਝ ਕੈ ਪ੍ਰਾਨ ਤਜੈ ਜੁਝਾਇਬੋ ਛਤ੍ਰਨ ਕੋ ਬਨ ਆਯੋ ॥
"To lose your life fighting in the hard of battle! This is what befits warriors!"

ਬਾਰਨੀ ਕੰਉ ਕਬਿ ਸ੍ਯਾਮ ਭਨੈ ਕਚੁ ਕੇ ਹਿਤ ਤੋ ਭ੍ਰਿਗ ਨਿੰਦ ਕਰਾਯੋ ॥
The Poet Shyaam *Guru Gobind Singh* speaks of this wine; which Bhrigu Rishi has spoken ill against due to the story of Kachu.

ਰਾਮ ਕਹੈ ਚਤੁਰਾਨਨਿ ਸੋ ਸੁ ਇਹੀ ਰਸ ਕਉ ਰਸ ਦੇਵਨ ਪਾਯੋ ॥1894॥
But the Poet Raam *Guru Gobind Singh* says, it is from Brahma that this nectar *that is wine* was obtained to the Gods *after the churning of the World-Ocean*.

Guru Gobind Singh makes reference to the story within the Mahabharata of the Rishi Bhirgu, who has spoken ill about the use of alcohol because it was used in a tale of deception against Shukrachrya *his son*, who under the guise of drinking alcohol also happened to consume the grinded remains of Kacha. Guru Gobind Singh then, in opposition to this position held by Rishi Bhigru, postulates his position regarding wine, citing the story of the Ocean-Churning where from the world's ocean the Devtey *Gods* produced 14 Jewels, from which one was wine, which Brahma taking gave to the Devtey *Gods*.
