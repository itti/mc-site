Did you know fireworks existed during the times of the Gurus? Guru Gobind Singh (1666-1708) when writing about the love the Gopis had for Krishna uses it in a metaphor for the flash of light, like fireworks in the dark of night, which was experienced when these love-sick women saw their beloved Krishna. 

ਤਿਨ ਗ੍ਵਾਰਿਨ ਕੋ ਅਤਿ ਹੀ ਪਿਖਿ ਪ੍ਰੇਮ ਤਬੈ ਪ੍ਰਗਟੇ ਭਗਵਾਨ ਸਿਤਾਬੀ ॥
Seeing the intense love the Gopis had, 
Bhagwan (Krishna) then quickly appeared before them

ਜੋਤਿ ਭਈ ਧਰਨੀ ਪਰ ਇਉ ਰਜਨੀ ਮਹਿ ਛੂਟਤ ਜਿਉ ਮਹਤਾਬੀ ॥
It appeared like such a flash of light upon the earth, 
as if fireworks going off in the dark of night

This particular type of firework mentioned above by Guru Gobind Singh, mehtābī ਮਹਤਾਬੀ, was a kind of firework which has an illumination like the moon, somewhat light blue, producing a burst of glittering sparks which fan out in a cascading pattern.

Sikh historical texts also mention fireworks (ਆਤਿਸ਼ਬਾਜ਼ੀ) as part of the celebrations at the weddings of the Gurus and on festivals like Diwali.
