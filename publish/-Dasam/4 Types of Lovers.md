The following translation is of the Dasam Granth commentary published by Baba Teja Singh Ji Nihang Singh Mahiron Vale, under the title, Dasam Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji Shiromani Steek. The commentary was written by Giani Isher Singh Ji Ramgharia Ropar.

ਅਥ ਚਤੁਰ ਪੁਰਖ ਭੇਦ ਕਥਨੰ ॥
Now begins the discussion regarding the markers of differences between the four types of persons (lovers).

ਨਰ ਏਕ ਅਕੀਨ ਹੀ ਪ੍ਰੀਤ ਕਰੈ ਇਕ ਕੀਨ ਕਰੈ ਇਕ ਕੀਨ ਜੁ ਜਾਨੈ ॥
There is one type of person who would love all, he does not look at whether he is being loved  reciprocally or not. With one discrimination they look upon all, just like Bhai Ghanaeya who loved all even if they were his enemy, these type of people are called 1) The Utmost Highest Person.

There is another type of person who only loves those who also reciprocate his love, and no one else. These type of people are called, 2) The Mediocre Person.

ਏਕਨ ਪ੍ਰੀਤ ਕੇ ਭੇਦ ਜਨੈ ਜੋਉ ਪ੍ਰੀਤਿ ਕਰੈ ਅਰ ਕੈ ਤਿਹ ਮਾਨੈ ॥
There is another person who does not reciprocate love even when he acknowledges and understands he is being bestowed with love. This type of mindset is represented in the 3) Low Person.

ਸੋ ਨਰ ਮੂੜ ਬਿਖੈ ਕਹੀਐ ਜਗ ਜੌ ਨਰ ਰੰਚ ਨ ਪ੍ਰੀਤ ਪਛਾਨੈ ॥
There is another person who does not reciprocate love even when he acknowledges and understands he is being bestowed with love. This type of mindset is represented in the 3) Low Person.

ਸੋ ਚਰਚਾ ਰਸ ਕੀ ਤਿਹ ਭਾਂਤ ਸੁ ਗ੍ਵਾਰਨੀਆਂ ਸੰਗ ਕਾਨ੍ਹ ਬਖਾਨੈ ॥509॥
There are other people who do not understand when they are being loved. Those who may be trying to love this type of person, is mistakenly taken for an enemy. This type of mindset is represented in the 4th) Vile Person. That person who doesn't understand love even a tiny bit, that person the world calls a fool.

In this way, Krishna in the company of the Gopis, discusses love.

There are some persons, who love without being loved; there are others, who love only when loved and consider such love as beneficence; there are such others who know differentiations in love and accept love in their mind

The fourth type of persons are such in the world who can be called fools because they do not comprehend love even a little; the gopis and Krishna are absorbed in such-like discussion.
