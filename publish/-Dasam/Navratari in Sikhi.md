ਮਹਿਖਾਸਰ ਕਹੱ ਮਾਰ ਕਰ ਪ੍ਰਫੁਲਤ ਭੀ ਜਗ ਮਾਇ ॥ 
The Goddess of the World was filled with happiness and laughed after killing the demon Maishasur.  

ਤਾ ਦਿਨ ਤੇ ਮਹਿਖੇ ਬਲੈ ਦੇਤ ਜਗਤ ਸੁਖ ਪਾਇ ॥38॥ 
From that day, the sacrifices *of goats and/or buffalos* on Navratri began, in order to bestow happiness on to the entire world. .

In the Rajput tradition, along with the Nihang tradition, this sacrifice for Devi Ma *The Goddess Mother* has continued to this day. "On the festival of Navratri, the kuldevi receives a special offering, a goat whose neck has been severed with a sword wielded by a Rajput. The goat represents the buffalo demon Mahishasur, who was slain by the goddess Durga; not so long ago some families sacrificed buffaloes, rather than goats, but the (relatively inexpensive) goat has become ubiquitous in contemporary sacrifices on Navratri, the festival of the "Nine Nights," or on Dashara, the festival of the "Tenth," the day after Navratri. Killing a goat with a single stroke of the sword is considered an initiation into manhood." The Goddess' Henchmen, page 20
