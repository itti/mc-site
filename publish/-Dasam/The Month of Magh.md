ਮਘ੍ਰ ਸਮੈ ਸਭ ਸਯਾਮ ਕੈ ਸੰਗ ਹੁਇ ਖੇਲਤ ਥੀ ਮਨ ਆਨੰਦ ਪਾਈ । 
In the month of Magh, we all get together and play with Krishna and experience great bliss! 

ਸੀਤ ਲਗੈ ਤਬ ਦੂਰ ਕਰੈ ਹਮ ਸਯਾਮ ਕੇ ਅੰਗ ਸੋ ਅੰਗ ਮਿਲਾਈ । 
It is cold, but we dispel this by merging our body with the body of Krishna.

A quote from Guru Gobind Singh's Barah Maha [the 12 Months]. The Barahmaha or Barahmasa is a poetic literary genre written across various languages in South Asia often devotional but sometimes secular.

"The barahmasa is a kind of poem in which an abandoned woman (virahini) pines for her absent lover or husband. It describes her pitiful state month by month against a backdrop of seasonal changes and ritual events" - Print and Pleasure by Orisini.
