Written in 1769 by Kesar Singh Chibbar, this text is a historical narrative written about the ten Gurus while focusing on the genealogical development of the Guru's lineages. The author's family had special access to the inner circles of the Guru's house, as the Chibbar family were courtiers within the courts of notably Guru Tegh Bahadur and Guru Gobind Singh. At one point within the text the author reflects on his time as a young child in the court of Mata Sahib Devan in Delhi. 

While the text is rather brief, it does offer important information related to the history of the Sikh Gurus and the tradition.
