According to Bansavalinama *1769CE*, written by Kesar Singh Chibbar, Guru Gobind Singh took a great love to learning Shastar Vidiya from the young age of three *pg 126*. The passage below speaks to how the young Guru used to train the ancient martial game of Saunchi.  
  
ਨਦੀ ਕਿਨਾਰੇ ਮਧ ਰੇਤੀ ਭੀ ਜਾਇ ਖੇਡਨ ਸਉਂਚੀ । ਬਾਜੂ ਬੰਦ, ਕੜੇ, ਦੁਰਮਾਲ ਸਰਨ ਜੜਾਊ ਕਰਿ ਪਉਂਚੀ ।  
Even in the thick sand of the river's banks, the Guru would play Saunchi, arriving by the river the Guru was adorned with gauntlets, war bracelets, a high turban and a pearl necklace.  
  
Bansavalinama *1769CE*, page 126

The Mahan Kosh describes Saunchi as a game, similar to Kabdi, wherein an opponent, the aggressor, has to strike a defender on the chest three times without having their arms caught by the defender. If the defender catches the aggressor's arm, then the aggressor has lost. If the aggressor has struck the defender three times and has retreated past his team's line, then he has won.
